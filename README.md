This is a project by Freecodecamp for the Relational database course.<br>

For this project, I created the database using PostgreSQL on celestial bodies.<br>

You can view the solution in <span><b>solution.txt</b></span> .<br>

The code is written in bash scripting so the original File name is universe.sql
